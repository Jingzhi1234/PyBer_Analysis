# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city, and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations will help PyBer improve 
access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
